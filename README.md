The app allows users to record details such as the date, location, weather conditions, water conditions, type of fish caught, size, bait used, and other personal notes. The purpose of logging these metrics is to enable anglers to analyze patterns over time, which can aid in planning future fishing trips, understanding fish behaviour, and improving overall fishing success.
